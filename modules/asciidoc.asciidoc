[[documentation-formats]]
== Documentation Formats

For the purpose of publishing documentation to the Customer Portal using the Docs2Drupal toolchain, CCS tooling supports two formats: *AsciiDoc* and *DocBook*. For many years, DocBook was the only format CCS supported, but AsciiDoc https://mojo.redhat.com/message/975985#975985[has a host of advantages and few drawbacks]. Additionally, many upstream communities that CCS works with are adopting AsciiDoc because itis easier to jump in and learn than DocBook and therefore it lowers the barrier for documentation contributions (and it doesn't hurt that Github supports _README.adoc_ for project descriptions).

For beginning new documentation projects, CCS recommends using AsciiDoc.

This is just another chapter that should only show in the embargoed version of this guide. If you are seeing this normally, then the embargoed date is not working as expected.
